# This repository contains a console-based Inventory Management System developed using C++, designed to efficiently manage warehouse inventory using Data Structures and Algorithms (DAA). The system focuses on fast searching, sorting, priority-based stock monitoring, and safe product removal operations.

By applying algorithms such as Merge Sort, Binary Search, and Heap, along with data structures like Stack, the project demonstrates how algorithmic efficiency improves real-world inventory operations.
